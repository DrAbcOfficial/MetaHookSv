## Features

### VGUI2-based Subtitle System

You can:

1. Display subtitles when sound is played

2. Display subtitles when sentence is played

3. Display subtitles when client receives HudText message

4. Display subtitles when client receives SendAudio message

The subtitles are defined in `\Sven Co-op\svencoop\captionmod\dictionary.csv`, which can be opened with Microsoft Excel or any other open-sourced CSV editors.

### HUDText Message Translation System

You can translate HUDText message into other language dynamically (regex supported)

There is a example file demostrates how to translate static HUD TextMessage to `schinese` , the file is at  `\Sven Co-op\svencoop_schinese\maps\restriction02_dictionary.csv`.

* To support [Windows 11 with system-wide UTF-8 enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/globalizing/use-utf8-code-page), you should always save `_dictionary.csv` as `UTF8-BOM`.

There is a example file demostrates how to translate dynamic HUD TextMessage to `schinese` using regex, the file is at `\Sven Co-op\svencoop\captionmod\dictionary_schinese.txt` called `#SVENCOOP_PLAYERINFO`.

* To support non-ASCII charachers in localization file, you should always save `_%language.txt%` (`_schinese.txt` / `_korean.txt`) as `UTF16-LE`.

### Mutli-byte character support for legacy VGUI1 and HUD elements

1. Client's HudText are overhauled with multi-byte character support. (Sven Co-op and Half-Life)

2. VGUI1 TextImage's are overhauled with multi-byte character support.

* You can see multi-byte characters rendered correctly on VGUI1 scoreboard. (Sven Co-op and Half-Life)

3. Client's HUDMenu are overhauled with multi-byte character support. (Sven Co-op only)

* You can see multi-byte characters rendered correctly on HudMenu.
